        		    <h2>The story:</h2>
        			<p>Justin comes from humble beginnings on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. It is there that he gained his love for 
        			lounging, lazing, and procrastination. He lived with his father, who worked as a handy-man doing odd-jobs to put food on the table,
        			and his sister, Lindsay. His free-spirited sister, two years his junior, was
        			his accomplice-in-crime adventuring around the neighborhoods of Kawaii Hai and, later, Aiea. These two rambunctious youth
        			lived out their childhoods in daily juxtaposition, experiencing the beautiful island life, carefree, while enduring
        			the trials and hardships of poverty. Their true escape came in the form of a one-way ticket, out of the quicksand of rising
        			property values and island crowding, to the cheap suburbs of Spokane, Washington.</p>
        
        			<!--
        			This paragraph contains a hyperlink 
        			-->
        
        			<p>It is there, in the land of pines and rainy weather, that Linsday and Justin vowed to climb out of the throes of mediocrity
        			and seek out advanced educations. Justin&rsquo;s path led him to the football fandom Mecca of <a href="https://wsu.edu/"><b>Washington State University</b></a>, and Lindsay&rsquo;s
        			to the hometown comfort and tranquility of Eastern Washington University. It was there that Justin decided his best path 
        			towards becoming an educated and productive member of society would be through military service. An attraction to the culture and 
        			comparatively higher standards led him to join the Air Force through the Reserve Officers Training Course offered as a cross-town partnership 
        			between WSU and the University of Idaho.</p>
        
        			<p>After four years of new friendships, new experiences, and new knowledge, Justin was ready to enter active duty in the US Air Force
        			as a 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant. The first obstacle he faced on his way to becoming a Cyberspace Operations officer was a greuling, merciless
        			technical training school dubbed Undergraduate Cyber Training. He entered the arena with 12 excellent classmates, each driven to 
        			establish a new domain in which America would be the leader in the emerging cyber battlefield. During this six month endeavour he was 
        			faced with ten hour days in a windowless building learning the <em>dark arts</em> of IT. Along the way he lost teammates, some to challenging
        			courses meant to weed out the History majors, and others to lapses in attention or diligence. A failed block of Undergraduate Cyber Training had big impacts on a young officer&rsquo;s career.
        
        			<!--Ordered list using uppercase letters-->
        			After a failure, the officer had three different options:</p> 
        
        				<ol type="A">
        					<li>Buckle down, study, pass, and graduate after your class rank has plummetted</li>
        					<li>Study and pass, just to fail in a future block</li> 
        					<li>Don't study and fail the same block again</li>				
        				</ol>
        			
        			<p>If options <strong>&lsquo;B.&rsquo;</strong> or <strong>&lsquo;C.&rsquo;</strong> occurred, then the officer faced re-training into a different career field, or possibly even discharge from the Air Force.</p>
        			
        			<!-- 
        			This paragraph contains a hyperlink 
        			-->
        
        			<p>Despite the struggles, the support of his then girlfriend and future wife, Colleen, and copious amounts of caffeine, helped guide him to 
        			victory over the Air Force&rsquo;s premier school. He emerged top of the class with Distinguished Graduate accolades and an assignment to the 
        			bustling ecosystem of <a href="http://www.ramstein.af.mil/"><b>Ramstein Air Base, Germany</b></a>. It is there he still resides, squandering the money better spent towards retirement, 
        			instead for trips to the birthplaces of cultures he can&rsquo;t fully comprehend with experiences he struggles to remember. So if you, my dear 
        			reader, find yourself in the chill of a German morning, be sure to hold out an IPA and say the magic letters, <em>&ldquo;LT&rdquo;</em>, and he will come running 
        			to meet you.</p>
